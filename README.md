## What's this repo?

I keep my musical scores for my compositions here in vextab format.

## ...Huh?
### First off, what's Vextab?

[Vextab][vextab] is a plaintext file format for describing musical scores, specifically for guitar music. It was intended to be easy to write and, imo, it's better than the alternatives I've looked at. Ideally, my stuff would be translated into MusicXML or some other standard compositional format to make it easier to actually autogenerate playable audio (e.g. MIDI files), but frankly this is good enough for my needs right now.

### "musical compositions"?

I've been playing guitar for 14 years at this point (before that I played violin for four years). Most of that time I've been playing classical-style guitar. For various reasons, though I can read guitar music, my sightreading is really slow. So every piece I know I have memorized.
Playing other people's compositions is a lot of fun- Sor, Carulli, Barrios-Mangore, etc.
However, every time I play I end up composing something and playing that instead.

About a year or two ago I decided to start recording the things I've been composing so I don't forget those pieces. At this point I have a collection of pieces I'm kinda proud of, and don't want to lose. Haven't put the recordings on the internet, because I think they're a bit rough and not ready for public consumption. But I do like them enough that I want to have actual musical scores for them.

Before two years ago I was terrible about recording things. So the only original composition I have recorded from before two years ago is [this guy][song_for_june], recorded on my phone at two in the morning. Compositionally, it's certainly not my best work. But I dunno. I still like it. Wrote it for my girlfriend at that time.
